            >What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
            At Dev Academy, we have a significant focus on human skills and improving yourself. 
            Based on your strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would like to work on?
            For example, this could be communication, teamwork within groups, pairing with others, giving 
            and receiving feedback, developing some leadership skills, or improving your self-awareness and reflective skills.</strong
          >
          </p>
          <p>
          Continue to work on communication, teamwork in groups, and leadership skills.

            how and where will you seek help in a timely way?Write down a commitment to how you 
            will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you

          First would be peer review, ask a friend and then talk to a facilitator. 
          My commitment is to work hard throughout the week days so I can use weekends to review the weeks learning competencies.
