          The problem when working through the kata. I used the internet, asked
          a friend and checked out the help desk. Frustrated as the answers did
          not present themselves. It might be easier to ask questions directy.

          I didn't feel like I solved anything, it was more of a muddle through.

          Pseudocode, I lost my way with this. Try something, this I did a bit
          to see what the out come was. Rubber Ducky method, Reading error
          messages, was still a mystery to me. The fails in the kata test really
          didn't make sense to me. Console.log, in the kata I couldn't get this
          to work and I was so far behind this week that I gave up trying to
          figure out how this worked. Googling, this was my first port when
          looking at questions, it helped in some of the first kata but lost my
          way later. Asking for peers, did not do this. Asking coaches, I
          checked the help desk for any question I had, but by the time I really
          needed to ask, it was the weekend. Improving with reflection, this
          week was a super-stressed out week, even with the mindfulness
          exercises, I have been banging my head. Literally this post sums up
          the how my brain feels...

          <strong>
            Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
            made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next
            time?</strong

          By the time I got to the kata it was late in the week, and a public
          holiday so I just checked the help desk to see if anyone else had the
          same question. I have been reluctant to ask for help, as I felt as
          though the kata exercises were fundamentals and that I'm might not be
          understanding basics. Next time I'm going to spam my coach with
          questions.
