          <strong> 1. Research Neuroplasticity </strong>

          Being aware that the brain is malleable, enables students to be
          unlocked by previous teaching methods and engage with learning. By
          acknowledging that learning is possible by any one of any age,
          practising activities to create new neural roadways, and shape a new
          skill superhighway. Push out of your comfort zone to form new neural
          connections that will strengthen learning.

          <strong> 2. Research Growth Mindset .</strong>
          <strong>Research:</strong>
          <a
            href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/growth-mindset">growth-mindset</a>
          <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/growth-mindset-characteristics-benefits-8575613">growth mindset characteristics benefits</a>

          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Growth mindset is process where language roadblocks, like not being
          able to learn something because you don’t have ‘talent’ or are not
          ‘gifted’, are pointed at positive acknowledgements and language so
          that all students are being able to learn and grow. The power of
          positive thinking is very powerful. Embrace learning, working hard,
          welcoming challenges, taking feedback constructively, failing forward.
          I have been following an oxymoron of ‘Get rid of the negative’ since I
          started, to look at the positive in work and not the negative of
          failure. Failure is positive, and helps you learn.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> 3. Blend with your learning plan and strategies</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Positive reinforcement, remove any negative language and understanding
          that the brain itself will learn as you challenge yourself, aids in a
          much happier mindset to work through difficult and constantly changing
          challenges. I will endeavour to challenge myself in the work in
          undertake.
