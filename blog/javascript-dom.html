        <div id="markup-box-2"><font color="yellow">{</font>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.<font color="yellow">}</font></div>
          <p>
          <strong>I believe the relationship of HTML, CSS and Javascript can be described as a human.</strong>  
          <br>HTML is the physical body, it's the core structure, it is simple in design, but complex and powerful. CSS is the attitude, the clothes, boots and style that dress our human. 
          And JS is the mind that allows the body to function, it is the unseen functions that enables humans to do all the cool stuff in life.

        <div id="markup-box-2"><font color="yellow">{</font>Explain control flow and loops.<font color="yellow">}</font></div>
          <p>
            <strong>Control flow refers to the order in which statements in a program are executed. Javascript offers a variety of control flow structures that enable developers to execute code based on conditions and loops.<em> What does this really mean in simpler terms?</em></strong>
            <br>Conditions are like getting dressed for work in the morning. Certain conditions of the day dictate what type of clothes you need to wear to get through the day. If it's raining you will need an umbrella or coat, if it's sunny you 
            can wear a light shirt or if it's windy then you need to carry an anchor.
            Loops are like repetitive tasks, unloading the dishwasher in the morning is a back and forth game between the sink and the cupboard. Starting the car, opening the garage and backing out the driveway 
            is daily chore for commuters. Doing the washing involves loading the washing machine, adding laundry liquid, setting the right cycle then unloading and hanging the clothes on the line.

            <div id="markup-box-2"><font color="yellow">{</font>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.<font color="yellow">}</font></div>
            <p>
              <strong>Document Object Model (DOM) is a tree structure that represents the objects that makeup the branches of a web page.</strong> 
              <br>You can set certain types of tasks for the JS to complete that will interact with the DOM and alter the structure or function of the web page.
              </p>

            <div id="markup-box-2"><font color="yellow">{</font>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.<font color="yellow">}</font></div>
              <p>
                <strong>An array is an ordered line of data elements which can be accessed by the position in the line.</strong>  <br>It is like a row of letterboxes running down the street, you can open each letter box but only one at a time once you have walked to it.
                <br><strong>An object is a data type containing unordered labeled values.</strong> <br>It is like a Car parked on the street, the car holds all the properties that makeup this car, its engine, wheels, comfy seats. Other objects can have the same properties, but the values differ from car to car.
                </p>
                <div id="markup-box-2"><font color="yellow">{</font>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.<font color="yellow">}</font></div>   
                <p>
                  <strong>A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task, it is executed when it is called.</strong> <br>It is like a starting your car, the ignition switch is the block of code to start the car, you insert the key in the ignition and turn for the car to start. 
                  Without the key turning in the ignition, the block of code cannot be 'called'. They are extremely helpful as they offer a way to use data to perform complex tasks or computations.
