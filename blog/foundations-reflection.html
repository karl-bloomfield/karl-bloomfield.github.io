          Being aware that the brain is malleable, enables students to be
          unlocked by previous teaching methods and engage with learning. By
          acknowledging that learning is possible by any one of any age,
          practising activities to create new neural roadways, and shape a new
          skill superhighway. Push out of your comfort zone to form new neural
          connections that will strengthen learning.

            ego due to the Human Skills learning?</strong

        </p>

        <p>1. That I’m not as chilled out under stress as I thought</p>
        <p>2. I sometimes find it hard to focus on conversations</p>
        <p>3. Taking breaks are very important</p>

          >What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?</strong

        <p>
          These tenants allow for a mind that can process problems and come up
          with solution sunder pressure while working with others

          focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp
          course?</strong

        <p>Because these skills are just as important as the tech skills.</p>
        <strong
          >Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like
          a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
          programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong

        <p>
          No, Human Skills are important and has benefit, so I don’t think it is
          a waste of time. But I also wish there was more time to practise
          programming.
